# Master Python: 100 Projects in 100 Days

Welcome to my journey of mastering Python by building 100 projects in 100 days! This repository showcases my daily progress, as I explore various domains of programming such as data science, automation, web development, game development, and app creation.

## About the Challenge

This challenge is inspired by the course **"Master Python by Building 100 Projects in 100 Days"**. It focuses on practical learning through project-based tasks, covering diverse topics and real-world applications.

## Goals
- Strengthen Python programming skills.
- Learn and apply concepts in data science, automation, and more.
- Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my growth and expertise.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Each folder contains:
- Source code for the project.
- A `README.md` file with a brief description of the project.
- Additional files or assets (if required).
